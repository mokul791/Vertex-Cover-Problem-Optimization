# Vertex-Cover-Problem-Optimization (C++, python)

Optimizing Number of Security Cameras at Traffic Intersection using Vertex Cover Problem Project (Undertaken as a course project for Methods and Tools for Software Engineering)

•	Constructed undirected graph and output a shortest-path from one vertex
•	Solved minimal Vertex Cover problem based on a polynomial time reduction to CNF-SAT using SAT solver
•	Analyzed running time and approximation ratio for three algorithms: Reduction-to-CNF-SAT, Approx -VC 1, Approx VC 2
